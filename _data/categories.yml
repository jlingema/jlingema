      <p>Software development for the Future Cirular Collider design study.</p>
      <p>The FCC brings current approaches and computing infrastructure to the limits. <strong>High performance</strong>
      becomes critical. At the same time we avoid re-inventing the wheel.</p>

    id: "trigger"
    desc: >
      <p>Work on the configuration software and simulation of a hardware based trigger.</p> <p><strong>
      What is triggering?</strong> The huge amount of information gathered in each collision at the Large Hadron
      Collider cannot all be saved. The hardware trigger decides what to keep.</p>
