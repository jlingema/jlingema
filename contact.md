Aim of this site is to give an impression of the projects I participated in.


The last year I have spent as a fellow at CERN, the european research center for nuclear sciences, where I work on the simulation and event processing framework to support the Future Circular Collider design study. I have spent most of my time automating our software testing and release procedures using continous integration, Docker and Spack (a software packaging framework).

For my graduate studies with the RWTH Aachen, I spent three years as a PhD student at CERN, through a stipend of the [Wolfgang-Gentner Programme](http://wolfgang-gentner-stipendien.web.cern.ch/wolfgang-gentner-stipendien/en/index.php). The results of my work are highlighted through links to the individual publications. Here I give an overview of the projects:

While working on my diploma thesis, I worked on data analysis. Specifically, I participated in analyses searching for physics beyond the particle physics standard model. The thesis topic is a measurement of the top quark mass, which employed similar selection and reconstruction techniques as the search I worked on.

My interest in programming grew rapidly upon starting my technical work as a PhD student on the hardware based first level trigger of the CMS experiment. I spent time on developing, simulating and testing new algorithms that could be implemented in the hardware platforms available. This lead to a deeper understanding of the inner workings of programmable hardware.

I also spent some time trying to pass on what I learned: I helped design an exercise that introduces students to the micro-TCA standard at an international school ([ISOTDAQ](https://isotdaq.web.cern.ch/isotdaq/isotdaq/Home.html) 2014). The next year I participated both as a tutor and a lecturer at the same school. I gave a lecture on [Programming for todays Physicists and Engineers](https://indico.cern.ch/event/557251/contributions/2245635/attachments/1310086/2146011/programming_isotdaq_joschka.pdf). I have repeated the participation each year since then.
