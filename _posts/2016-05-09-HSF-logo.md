The HEP Software Foundation as looking for a new logo: The lines together with the "S" form one of the simplest Feynman-Diagrams, tools to describe the interaction of fundamental particles. Namely, the pictured process is the so-call Drell-Yan process where two charged fermions (e.g. electrons) exchange a photon (the mediator of the electro-magnetic force).

My submission won the competition and is now the official logo of the [HEP Software Foundation](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), a group that facilitates coordination and common efforts in high energy physics (HEP) internationally.
