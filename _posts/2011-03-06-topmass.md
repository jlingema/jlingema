A measurement of the top quark mass from the invariant mass spectrum of top quark pairs. Data taken with the CMS experiment during the first year of running is analysed. Both electron plus jets and muon plus jets channels are considered. The presented analysis approaches were developed participating the search of narrow resonances within the invariant mass spectrum described above. These methods were adapted to the measurement.

To measure the the top quark mass, templates are derived from Monte Carlo simulations at different top quark masses and the estimated background contributions. To quantify the comparison of the different templates with the taken data, the binned likelihood technique based on Poisson statistics is used.
