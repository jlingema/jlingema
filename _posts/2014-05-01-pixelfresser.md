Back-end done in php. The aim was to make addition of new content as easy as possible.

The content is completely driven by the folder structure in the webspace: Images are searched for and added to the site, descriptions can be placed in .txt files alongside the pictures. Categories are based on folders. The artist only has to upload and hit refresh.
