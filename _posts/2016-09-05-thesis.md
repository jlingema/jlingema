The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is one of two general purpose detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the particle physics research laboratory in Geneva (CERN).
Due to the high rate of collisions at the LHC, a trigger system is needed that selects collision events of interest. This system consists of two levels: A first hardware based system that is optimised for speed and a second that is software based with more precise and slower algorithms.
This thesis describes the design of the Micro-Global Muon Trigger (uGMT), a central part of the muon trigger that receives all muon candidates of a collision event.

Several studies are presented that allow to effectively decrease the data volume to be saved while keeping a high signal efficiency. An emulator is presented that allows to simulate the hardware behaviour. Also the software to control and monitor the hardware is described.
