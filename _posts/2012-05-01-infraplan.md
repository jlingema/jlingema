The website is based on wordpress, but the skin is customised for the use in this office.

One prerequisite was an easy integrated way to add lists of project, detail-views of projects and also a team site, all created through articles, not pages.

Several templates were created that are controlled through custom fields to only display certain categories of articles and the view is customised for each, to either give a compact overview or show details.
