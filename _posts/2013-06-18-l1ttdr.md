This technical design report (TDR) covers the plans of the upgrade of the hardware based first level trigger of the CMS experiment at the LHC. It also contains some estimates on the possible performance with the upgraded system.

My contribution was to section 2.3, where the performance of the upgraded muon trigger is described. Specifically, I estimated the improvements that can be made to the triggering algorithms with the introduction of a calorimeter based isolation, both before the full upgrade and after.
