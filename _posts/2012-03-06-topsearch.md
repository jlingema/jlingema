A search for massive neutral bosons decaying to top-antitop pairs. The analysis is performed on the dataset of 2011 both in the electron plus jets and muon plus jets channel.

Selection and reconstruction are optimised for production of top quark pairs close to rest. The results are presented as limits on the cross section for massive bosons such as Z' or Kaluza Klein Gluons.

My contribution were studies on the estimation of the W boson and optimising the association of the decay products with the top quark. In the previous version of the analysis I had studied the effects of the application of a kinematic fit to optimise the reconstruction of the top quarks.
