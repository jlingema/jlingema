These proceedings for a poster presentation at the TWEPP workshop in 2013 present the most up to date publication of the plans for the upgraded Global Muon Trigger (GMT). Minor details have changed since, but the algorithm description is still mostly accurate. The text focusses on the description of the technical details, such as the hardware in which the GMT will be deployed and implementation details.

As part of my PhD thesis, I work on new algorithms that can improve the performance of the muon trigger and testing the implementation in hardware.
