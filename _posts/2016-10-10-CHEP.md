The Future Circular Collider (FCC) software effort is supporting the different experiment design studies for the three future collider options, hadron-hadron, electron-electron or electron-hadron. The software framework used by data processing applications has to be independent of the detector layout and the collider configuration. The project starts from the premise of using existing software packages that are experiment independent and of leveraging other packages that can be easily modified to factor out any experiment dependency.
At the same time, new components are being developed also allowing usage outside of the FCC software project; for example the event data model is generated from configuration files, allowing easy customisation, and enables parallelisation by supporting a corresponding data layout.

Proceedings currently being prepared.
